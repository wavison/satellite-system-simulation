# To use the visualisation tool for this scenario, in git, navigate to:
# app > msd > SatelliteGeometry
# and clone/download this repo into the directory
# technicalsupport
# within which the TechnicalSupportJar lies.
#
# Will create a custom LUT to be used in the power budget tool
#
# ****BODY****
# Central body to attach any solar panels to
# Format: [x dimension [m],y dimension [m],z dimension [m]]
# DIMENSIONS=0,0,0
# Solar cell area to assign each of the facets
# Format: [ +x area of solar cells [m^2] , +y area of solar cells [m^2] ,+z area of solar cells [m^2], 
#			-x area of solar  cells [m^2] ,-y area of solar cells [m^2] ,-z area of solar cells  [m^2] ]
# SOLAR_AREA_FOR_FACETS= 0,0,0,0,0,0
#
# ****SOLAR_PANELS****
# Solar panels to attach to the body. 
# Below are the possible choices and the parameters required for each.
# NOTE: 
# - you CANNOT combine solar panels of different types.
# - you cannot place perpendicular type solar panels in the 
#		y direction as this is just a translation of frames when using another 
#		senario and would require (unnecessary) extensive work in the backend.
# Simply copy and paste the solar panel input from below and change the name 
# of the panel to increase by 1 for every panel added.
#
# Agrument 1 : TYPE > the type of solar panel. The choices are: PERP,PETAL,DIAG
# Argument 2 : PANEL_SELECTOR > Selects which panel is being referred to.
#					for type PETAL, this represents whether the panel is:
#						- attached at the plus x facet > +X
#						- attached at the plus y facet > +Y
#						- attached at the minus x facet > -X
#						- attached at the minus y facet > -Y
#					for type PERP, this represents whether the panel is:
#						- attached at the plus x facet  > +X
#						- attached at the minus x facet > -X
#					the choices are listed above in the list.
# Argument 3 : QUADRANT_TO_PLACE > the quadrant of the axis to place the panel in. 
#					the choices are: PLUS,MINUS
#					for type PETAL, this represents whether the panel is:
#						- at the 'top' of the body in the plus z quadrant.
#						- at the 'bottom' of the body in the minus z quadrant.
#					for type PERP, this represents whether the panel is 
#						- at the 'front' of the body in the plus x quadrant 
#						- at the 'back' of the body in the minus x quadrant.
# Argument 4 : ANGLE_FROM_USUAL > the angle of the solar panel to protrude from the body.
#					for type PETAL, this represents the angle from:
#						- the minus z axis of the body if the panel is in the plus z quadrant. 
#						- the plus z axis of the body if the panel is in the minus z quadrant. 
#					for type PERP, this represents whether the panel is 
#						- the plus x axis of the body if the panel is in the minus x quadrant.
#						- the minus x axis of the body if the panel is in the plus x quadrant.
# Argument 5 : SOLAR_AREA_INSIDE_ANGLE_PER_DEPLOYABLE > the solar panel area for the facet on the 
							inside of the angle specified per single deployable.
# Argument 6 : SOLAR_AREA_OUTSIDE_ANGLE_PER_DEPLOYABLE > the solar panel area for the facet on the
							outside of the angle specified per single deployable.
# Argument 7 : MULTIPLE_DEPLOYABLE > the number of panels you want of the specified type.
#					the choices are: SINGLE,DOUBLE,TRIPLE
# 
# SOLAR_PANEL_{INSERT_NUMBER_FROM_1_TO_N}= TYPE,PANEL_SELECTOR,QUADRANT_TO_PLACE,ANGLE_FROM_USUAL,SOLAR_AREA_INSIDE_ANGLE_PER_DEPLOYABLE,SOLAR_AREA_OUTSIDE_ANGLE_PER_DEPLOYABLE,MULTIPLE_DEPLOYABLE
#
# ****VISUALISATION_TOOL****
# VISUAL_AID: whether to use a visualisation tool. Choices are: True, False
#
# An example to make a 3U single perp:
#
# DIMENSIONS=0.1,0.1,0.3
# SOLAR_AREA_FOR_FACETS= 0,0,0,0,0,0
# NUMBER_OF_SOLAR_PANELS=2
# SOLAR_PANEL_1= PERP,+X,PLUS,0,0,0.015,DOUBLE
# SOLAR_PANEL_2= PERP,-X,PLUS,0,0,0.015,DOUBLE
# VISUAL_AID=True
# (the above has solar panels which are 50% solar cell)
#
# An example of making MANTIS:
# DIMENSIONS=0.23,0.23,0.34
# NUMBER_OF_SOLAR_PANELS=4
# SOLAR_AREA_FOR_FACETS=0.0424,0,0.0106,0,0,0
# SOLAR_PANEL_1= PETAL,+X,MINUS,135,0.0424,0,DOUBLE
# SOLAR_PANEL_2= PETAL,-X,PLUS,135,0,0.0424,DOUBLE
# SOLAR_PANEL_3= PETAL,+Y,PLUS,45,0,0.0424,SINGLE
# SOLAR_PANEL_4= PETAL,-Y,PLUS,45,0,0.0424,SINGLE
# VISUAL_AID=True
